# Heart Failure Prediction using CatBoost
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of heart failure using the **CatBoost** algorithm. The dataset includes clinical records of patients, and the goal is to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart failure.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Model Used**: CatBoostClassifier
- **Dataset**: Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset
- **Goal**: Binary classification (death event: 1 or 0)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

## 📁 Files in this Repository

- `heartfailureprediction-catboost-analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code and visualizations.
- `dataset/`: (You can upload or link if dataset included)
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🧠 Key Steps

1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature importance visualization
4. Model training using CatBoost
5. Model evaluation
6. Insights and interpretation

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- CatBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
